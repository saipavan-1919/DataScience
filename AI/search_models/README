	Path finding is one of the example in the searching problems in AI
																	
																
	Steps in Search problem:
		• Initial state	Starting state of the problem
		Actions	Actions need to be taken for next steps
		Transition model	A model which will try to find the best steps for finding solution
		Goal test	Check whether we reached the solution or not
		Path cost function	Steps/time took to reach the destination 
	
	Node:
		• A data structure that keeps the track of 
			§ State
			§ A parent node (node that generated this node)
			§ An function (action applied to parent node to get this node)
			§ A path cost (steps/ time take from initial state to this node)
	
	Approach:
		• Start with a frontier that contains the initial state (head)
		• Keep the track of explored states list
		• Repeat
			§ If the frontier is empty, then no solution
			(if there is no starting point then we can find the solution)
			§ Remove a node from the frontier (move the node to next node)
			§ Add the present node into the explored nodes list
			§ If node contains goal state return the solution
			§ Expand node, add resulting nodes to the frontier If the node is not explored
	
	Depth-First search (DFS)
		In this mode we use the stack method to find the solution (last come first out)(searches a path completely)
		Lets consider a path example like below:
			Problem : find path from node a to node e
		
					
		In this model DFS it will follow steps like below
			• Starts from node a
			• Goes to node b
			• Then adds both nodes c and d to the list [c,d]
			• This method will goes to node d as this follows stack flow (last come first out)
			• Then goes to node f and as there is no way goes back to node c
			• Then goes to node e and as e is the destination returns the result
		Once this enters a path then it will go to the end of the path that's why this is called as Depth First search (DFS)
		In this process total steps taken : 5
		Some times this process will take the longer steps as this goes till end of a path when entered
		In this process sometimes we can find the destination sometimes it takes the long depends on the decision taken by model
		
	Breadth-First search (BFS):
		In this method we use the queue method (first come first out) (goes step by step in each path)
		Lets consider the same example as above to explain this method too:
Problem : find path from node a to node e
						
		In this BFS model it will follow the steps like below
			• Starts from node a
			• Goes to node b
			• Then adds node c and d to the list [c,d]
			• Then goes to node c and then node d
			• In next step goes to node e as e is the destination returns the result
		Whenever it takes a decision it will go paralelly in all side
		In this process total steps taken : 4
		In this process this follows the similar steps so it will find the destination in less number of steps sometimes.
		
		
	We can divide the Search Algorithms into 2 categories
		1) Uniformed search
			Search strategy uses no problem specific knowledge 
			Ex: DFS (Depth First search) and BFS (Breadth First search)
		2) Informed search
			Search strategy used problem specific knowledge to find the solution more efficiently
			Ex: In a maze it know the coordinates of starting point, ending point and it uses the current position coordinates 
       to go to the destination.
			Greedy best First search (GBFS)
